Simple sample app to demonstrate how to store app settings in Zepp OS.

Some settings are meant to be changed by the user in the settings menu.  I have been able to store the user choices on the "settings" side, but I do not know how to transfer them to the "app-side" side, and refresh the app with the new settings.
(These are still in progress as I do not know how to set them up - help required üôè)

Settings:-
1. Date Format (variable "dateFormat" - settings menu) - the user will choose the date format in the settings menu and this should be retained even after the app has been closed, and reload with these new settings.
2. Temperature unit (variable "tempUnit" - settings menu) - the user will choose the temperature unit in the settings menu and this should be retained even after the app has been closed, and reload with these new settings.

For these, the settings menu has not been set up at all as I do not have any idea how to go about it, with no examples in the documentation.
